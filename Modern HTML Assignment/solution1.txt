Q1. List out the features of HTML5.



HTML5, the fifth major revision of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here is a list of some of the key features of HTML5:
1. Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced a set of new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, <aside>, and more, which provide better structure and meaning to web documents.
2. Audio and Video Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the <audio> and <video> elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
3. Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic rendering of 2D graphics and animations through JavaScript, making it suitable for interactive games and multimedia applications.
4. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 supports SVG for vector graphics rendering, enabling the creation of high-quality, scalable images directly in the browser.
5. Geolocation: HTML5 provides an API for obtaining a user's geographic location, making it possible to build location-aware web applications.
6. Local Storage: The ‘localStorage’ and ‘sessionStorage’ APIs allow web applications to store data on the client-side, which can persist even after the browser is closed.
7. Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the Web Storage API, which provides a more efficient way to store data on the client-side than traditional cookies.
8. Web Workers: Web Workers enable multi-threading in web applications, allowing time-consuming tasks to run in the background without freezing the user interface.
9. Drag and Drop: HTML5 includes native support for drag-and-drop operations, simplifying the implementation of interactive features.
10. Web Sockets: Web Sockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time communication between the client and server.
11. Responsive Design: HTML5 encourages the creation of responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, improving the user experience on mobile devices and desktops.
12. Form Input Types: HTML5 introduces new input types such as date, email, number, color, and range, which provide better input validation and user experience.
13. New Attributes: Several new attributes were introduced, like placeholder, required, autofocus, and pattern, which enhance form elements' functionality and usability.
14. Improved Accessibility: HTML5 includes features to improve web accessibility, such as the alt attribute for images and the <figure> and <figcaption> elements for better image descriptions.
15. Application Cache: The Application Cache (AppCache) API allows web applications to work offline by caching resources, reducing the need for constant internet connectivity.
16. Cross-document Messaging: The ‘postMessage()’ method enables secure communication between windows or iframes, even when they come from different domains.
17. Web Storage: HTML5 introduced localStorage and sessionStorage for storing data on the client-side, providing a more efficient alternative to cookies.
18. Drag-and-Drop API: HTML5 includes native support for implementing drag-and-drop functionality within web applications.
19. Offline Application Support: HTML5 introduced the concept of web applications that can work offline, providing a better user experience when there's no internet connection.
20. Improved Security: HTML5 includes features like the ‘sandbox’ attribute for iframes, content security policies (CSP), and improvements to HTTPS support to enhance web security.
These are just some of the key features of HTML5 that have contributed to its popularity and its ability to create modern and interactive web applications.
