Q4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.




Improving the accessibility of HTML can be achieved through various techniques and practices. Here are three key ways to enhance the accessibility of HTML content:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements: Semantic HTML elements provide meaningful structure to web content. By using these elements appropriately, you can improve the accessibility of your web pages. Some examples of semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <figure>, and <figcaption>. These elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the organization and purpose of content on a page.

2. Provide Alternative Text for Images: Including descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images is crucial for web accessibility. Alt text should convey the content and function of images to users who cannot see them, including individuals with visual impairments or those who have disabled image loading. Use the alt attribute in the <img> element to specify alt text. Make sure the alt text is concise, accurate, and meaningful.

3. Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Attributes: ARIA is a set of attributes and roles that can be added to HTML elements to enhance their accessibility in dynamic web applications. ARIA roles define the type of element, while attributes provide additional information. Common ARIA roles include role="button", role="link", role="menu", and role="alert". Properly applying ARIA roles and attributes can help assistive technologies understand the purpose and behavior of interactive elements.
